## Here's a couple things to keep in mind about this template:

1. This plugin depends on the Cornerstone Page Builder plugin to be installed first. Learn more here: http://theme.co/cornerstone/

2. It is strongly suggested that you keep the Plugin name in the following format:
   "Cornerstone Library: {{your custom name here}}"

3. You'll need to replace each instance of "Template Name" with your own custom name: (recommend search-replace across all files, case sensitive)
   - Template_Name
   - template_name
   - template-name
   - Template Name

4. Here's some useful tips for building your own element:
  - Browse the elements already made in Cornerstone to see what types of fields you can use: yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/cornerstone/includes/modules/elements
  - Check out the Themeco documentation (in case you missed it above): https://theme.co/community/kb/cornerstone-custom-elements/ 

5. When you are finished creating your custom element, submit it at http://cornerstonelibrary.com/submit !!!
